What is your favorite movie?
Good Will Hunting

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Iceland 

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
My super power would be luck.  I think have good luck at all times is a superpower that is very powerful, but also a power that I don't 
see myself abusing like other powers might.  I also think that Good luck would not drastically change my life or how others see me like having 
super strength or flight would.  I'd probably most appreciate it whenever I am driving to School and I never get stuck in traffic or all the lights are Green.
